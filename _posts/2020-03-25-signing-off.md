I don't know if we will be able to survive this. Supplies are running low, still can't find any TP. Those that haven't become mindless hording zombies are just trying to cope any way they can. From mindless hours of entertainment to talking to others though video chat like they are actually there. A few have gone completely insane thinking they are seeing clowns. I don't know how much longer we can hold out, but we will try for as long as we can. The world will need lawyers to sort though this mess once it is all over. We must survive.

This is Mike signing off.
